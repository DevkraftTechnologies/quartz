#  LangChain

[LangChain](https://github.com/hwchase17/langchain) is a framework for developing applications powered by language models

- It can call a language model via an API
- It can also connect [[notes/20230628030810 Large Language Models (LLMs)|LLMs]], like GPT-4, LLaMDA, and LLaMA, to other sources of data such as Google Drive, Wikipedia and allow them to interact with them 
- It can chain commands together so the AI model can know what it needs to do to produce the results or perform the actions needed
