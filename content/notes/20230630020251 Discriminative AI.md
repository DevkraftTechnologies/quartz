# Discriminative AI

Discriminative AI is useful when we want to make some sort of **decision**

For example, we might want to predict whether someone is at risk for cancer given some biometric data - height, weight, blood pressure, etc.

Not all Discriminative AI techniques model a [[notes/20230630021015 Conditional Distribution|Conditional Distribution]] because not all Discriminative AI methods even model a distribution in the first place.

For example, **Support Vector Machines** are **NOT** **probabilistic**, but SVM are still used for Discriminative AI
