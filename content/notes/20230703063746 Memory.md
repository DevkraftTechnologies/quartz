# Memory

LLMs process each query independently of other interactions. 

LangChain provides memory components to manage and manipulate previous chat messages and incorporate them into chains. 

LangChain's memory components can be used to retrieve data from memory or store data in memory. 

This is important for chatbots, for example, which need to remember previous conversations.
