# PgVector

- [PgVector](https://github.com/pgvector/pgvector) supports up to 16,000 dimensions for storage and 2,000 for indexing
- PgVector supports exact KNN which is what most apps just starting their journey (<10k docs) need
- It supports IVF ANN for larger collections
- postgres natively supports several additional composite index types, including BTREE GIST and GIN, for tabular, text and json data in addition to vector indexes.
- SQL databases in general (along w/ OpenSearch) are significantly (orders of magnitude) ahead of Pinecone in terms of scalability which limits a pod size to ~5M vectors
- The HNSW algorithmic advantage may be 2-10x as fast as IVF __in memory__, but it's <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">100x slower to go over the network to a different datacenter like Pinecone </mark>than using the database in the same VPC, so that "advantage" is situational at best
- [[notes/20230703073417 PostgresML|PostgresML]] takes another network trip out of the equation
- Beside the simple vector recall, It runs the embedding model itself on input text inside the same memory space
