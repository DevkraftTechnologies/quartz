# Modern Generative AI

[[notes/20230628030901 Generative AI|Generative AI]] is not a new tech, but the recent explosion in performance and interest can be attributed to advances made in the last 5 years

In the image space (models like [DALL-E 2](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/how-dall-e-2-actually-works/), [Imagen](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/how-imagen-actually-works/), [Stable Diffusion](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/stable-diffusion-1-vs-2-what-you-need-to-know/), etc.), advances have relied on the development of [Diffusion Models](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/diffusion-models-for-machine-learning-introduction/).

In the language space (models like [ChatGPT](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/how-chatgpt-actually-works/), GPT-4, etc.), advances have been made by the [scaling](https://www.assemblyai.com/blog/emergent-abilities-of-large-language-models/) of the [Transformer](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_UVfwBqcnbM&ref=assemblyai.com) architecture.
