# Transformers

## Overview

- Transformers were introduced in [[notes/202308090446 Attention is All You Need|Attention is All You Need]]
- The power of the transformer architecture lies in its ability to learn the relevance and context not just of each word next to its neighbor ![[notes/images/Screenshot 2023-08-07 at 5.12.02 AM.png]] but to every other word in the sentence ![[notes/images/Screenshot 2023-08-07 at 5.13.21 AM.png]]
- It is able to set attention weights to those relationships so that the model learns the relevance of each word to each other word no matter where it is in the input ![[notes/images/Screenshot 2023-08-07 at 5.06.37 AM.png]]!
- This diagram above is called an attention map and is useful to illustrate the attention weights between each word and every other word ![[notes/images/Screenshot 2023-08-07 at 5.09.34 AM.png]]
- The word book is strongly connected with or paying attention to the word teacher and the word student. This is called self-attention
- \Transformers use [[notes/20230703013343 Attention|Attention]] mechanisms instead of recurrence [[notes/20230703012211 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)|Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)]] to remember information, making them faster and **parallelizable**
