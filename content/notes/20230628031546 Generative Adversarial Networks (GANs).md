# Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

Generative Adversarial Networks or GANs are a type of neural network that uses two competing networks - a generator and a discriminator

- The generator creates fake outputs, and 
- The discriminator tries to tell the difference between the fake outputs and real-world data

Through this back-and-forth process, the GAN is able to produce outputs that are indistinguishable from real data
