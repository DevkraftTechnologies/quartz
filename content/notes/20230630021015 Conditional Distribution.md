# Conditional Distribution

A conditional distribution provides the probability of A occurring given B

For example, we can ask what the probability of rolling a specific number on a 6 sided die is. 

For a fair die, the probability will be ⅙ for all numbers on the die. 

Now, consider how these probabilities change when we are given extra information. What if we are told that the number we rolled was even? 

With this information, the probabilities the number being a 1, 3, or 5 are now zero, and the probabilities of rolling a 2, 4, or 6 are now ⅓.
