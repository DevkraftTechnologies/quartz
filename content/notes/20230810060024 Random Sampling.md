# Random Sampling

Instead of selecting the most probable word every time with random sampling, the model chooses an output word at random using the probability distribution to weight the selection. 

It reduces the likelihood that words will be repeated

However, in some cases the output might end be too creative, producing words that cause the generation to wander off into topics or words that just don't make sense

top-p and top-k are sampling techniques used to limit the random sampling and increase the chance that the output will be sensible
