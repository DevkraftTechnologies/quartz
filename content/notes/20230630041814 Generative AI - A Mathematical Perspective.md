#  Generative AI - A Mathematical Perspective

Generative AI is modeling a [[notes/20230630021029 Joint Distribution|Joint Distribution]] because the distribution itself is the object of interest

once we model the distribution, we can use it for different outcomes

- we can perform density estimates for example estimating the probabilities of someone being taller than 71 in (180 cm) and lighter than 150 lbs (68 kg)
- we can sample from this distribution to generate novel data, which we can do for various reasons.
  - use the generated data to train another AI model.
  - use the generated data in its own right as we do with models like DALL-E 2
