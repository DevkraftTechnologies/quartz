# Vector Database

These databases contain arrays of numbers clustered together based on similarities, which can be queried with ultra-low latencies

In other words, vector databases index vectors for fast search and retrieval by comparing values and finding those that are most similar to one another.

vector databases can used to store [[notes/20230703031649 Word Embeddings|Embedding]]s and perform queries

we can use vector databases to <mark style="background: #BBFABBA6;">extend large language models with long-term memory</mark>

- start with general-purpose model, like GPT-4, [LLaMA](https://github.com/facebookresearch/llama), or [LaMDA](https://blog.google/technology/ai/lamda/) but provide custom data in a vector database. 
- When a user gives a prompt, we can run queries for relevant documents in the database to update the context, which will customize the final response. 

vector databases integrate with tools like [[notes/20230703061520 LangChain|LangChain]] that combine multiple LLMs together
