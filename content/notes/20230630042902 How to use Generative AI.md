# How to use Generative AI

The most general way to think about [[notes/20230628030901 Generative AI|Generative AI]] is as a mapping from (potential) antecedents to desired consequents

Let’s say that the **goal** is to become the preeminent brand in the X market. 

A Y% increase in shares of  roduct X on social media is the **measurable outcome** that serves as a good **proxy** for **measuring progress** towards our **goal**.

what we are doing is seeking to **implement some change or idea** (an antecedent) that will lead to the **desired outcome** (the consequent).

we don’t _know_ if an idea is  an antecedent. That is, will the implementation of this idea actually lead to the desired consequent? 

Therefore it is our job to investigate, implement, and iterate on multiple potential antecedents in an attempt to observe the desired consequent

We must establish, to the best of our ability, that an idea is in fact an antecedent to the desired consequent - i.e. that the change **entails** the consequent

The critical point here is that **the implementation details of the potential antecedents are the bottleneck in this process**. 

It is straightforward to think of what outcome we _want_ and to think of what change _might lead_ to that result

but the details of _how_ we bridge the two is the challenge. 

Regardless of the specific domain, the **human implementation details** are where the bulk of the work is to be done and where the bottleneck occurs.

Generative AI can be thought of **as a tool to build the bridge between the potential antecedents and the desired consequent**.

we can use Generative AI in order to **expedite implementation details** involved with putting these ideas into action
