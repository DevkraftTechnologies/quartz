# Scope Stage

The most important step in the project is to define the scope as accurately and narrowly as possible

[[notes/20230628030810 Large Language Models (LLMs)|LLMs]] are capable of carrying out several tasks, but their abilities depend on the size and architecture of the model. 

Think about what function the LLM will have in the specific application. 

- Is the model required to perform out several different tasks including long-form text generation **OR**
- Is the task much more specific like named entity recognition so that the model needs to be good at one thing alone

Being specific about what we need the model to do can save time and perhaps more important compute cost
