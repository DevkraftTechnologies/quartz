# Generative AI project Life Cycle

The [[notes/20230628030901 What is Generative AI|Generative AI]] project Lifecycle is a guide through the individual stages and decisions we have to make when developing Generative AI applications

Then as a follow up, whether we want to fine tune and customize that model for our specific data

> when do you need a giant model, 100 billion (or bigger) parameters
>
> and when can a 1-30 billion parameter model or
>
> or even sub 1 billion parameter model made to work for a specific application?

>Â we can use quite small models and still get quite a lot of capability out of them
