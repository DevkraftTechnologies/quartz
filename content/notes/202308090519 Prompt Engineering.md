# Prompt Engineering

**Prompts** are the text that we feed into the model. The **act of generating text** is known as **Inference** and the **output text** is known as the **completion**

The model doesn't produce the desired outcome the first attempt **quite often** so we revise the language in the prompt several times 

This practise of developing and improving the prompt is known as **Prompt Engineering**
